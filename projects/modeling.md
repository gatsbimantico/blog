> <q>You seem taken out of a magazine</q>

Or so did said my wife a couple of times before I jumped into another **crazy idea** and attempt to become a model.

It's my philosophy for life:

> <q>On every opportunity: evaluate the risk and do it; risking to lose an opportunity is not an option.</q>

So I did and went for a couple of photoshoots, participate as extra in a couple of Bollywood movies, rethink my instagram, and read about this question that I'll try to solve during this new path **How do I sell myself better?**.

Because that's what this opportunity is about, on how to overcome the following issues:

## 1. Self-esteem

<q>My english is not good</q>, <q>My singing is not good</q>, <q>My code is not good enough</q>, <q>I'm ugly</q>,... those close to me know the million of excuses I use to not face a simple thing: **I love myself and I'm proud of me**.

But having a good concept of myself when I'm calm meditating in a quiet room is not enough for the world, the world is demanding and expects from us to step up, to be confident on our actions, to take responsibility.
And that's scary.

## 2. Fear

## 3. Lazyness

## 4. Health
